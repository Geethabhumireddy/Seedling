# GitHub Issue Analyzer (AI-Powered)

## Overview

This project is an AI-powered GitHub Issue Analyzer that fetches issue data from public GitHub repositories and generates structured, actionable insights using a Large Language Model (LLM).

The application converts unstructured GitHub issue discussions into a standardized JSON format to help maintainers and contributors quickly understand issue type, priority, and potential impact.

## Core Features

### 1. Input UI
- Simple and clean interface to input:
  - Public GitHub repository URL
  - Issue number
- Built using Streamlit for rapid prototyping and usability.

### 2. Backend Logic
- Lightweight backend implemented in Python.
- Triggers issue analysis based on user input.
- Modular separation of:
  - GitHub API data fetching
  - AI analysis logic
  - UI rendering

### 3. AI Core
- Fetches the following using GitHub REST API:
  - Issue title
  - Issue body
  - Issue comments
- Processes issue context using a Large Language Model.
- Produces output in a strict and consistent JSON schema.

### 4. Output Display
- Displays AI-generated analysis in a clean and readable format.
- Ensures structured visualization of JSON output.

### Note on JSON Output Format

The JSON output shown above is copied directly from the application’s response panel without any manual modification.

The application is designed to generate output strictly in the required JSON schema, allowing the result to be directly copied and reused for downstream processing, tooling, or analysis. The pasted output below represents an actual response generated by the system for the given input.

{
  "summary": "Update the Misc/NEWS processing logic to support and correctly handle legacy 'bpo-' bug tracker references.",
  "type": "feature_request",
  "priority_score": "2 - Improves internal tooling and changelog consistency for legacy references",
  "suggested_labels": ["tooling", "Misc/NEWS", "enhancement"],
  "potential_impact": "Enables proper tracking and linking of legacy Python bug tracker IDs within the project's changelog system."
}


## AI-Generated JSON Output Format

```json
